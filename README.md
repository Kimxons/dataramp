# Example
```python
# Create and register a model pipeline
preprocessor = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer())
])

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('preprocess', preprocessor),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression())
])

model_save(pipeline, "classifier", method="joblib", metadata={"dataset": "2023_sales"})
register_model(
    pipeline,
    name="sales_classifier",
    version="v1.0",
    metadata={
        "metrics": {"accuracy": 0.89},
        "serialization_method": "joblib"
    }
)

# Create versioned dataset
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
data_save(df, "processed_data", versioning=True, description="Initial cleaned version")
```
